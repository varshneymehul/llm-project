Updated Plan
# Enhancing Git Repository Analysis with Advanced LLM Techniques

Before diving into the main report, here's a summary of key recommendations: Your project has strong potential for novelty by implementing a multi-agent system with specialized roles for repository analysis, incorporating graph-based structural representations of code evolution, and developing hybrid evaluation metrics that combine automated and human assessment techniques.

## Novelty Opportunities

Looking at your current project plan, there are several promising directions to add novelty beyond basic RAG implementation:

### Multi-Agent Collaborative System

Instead of a single agent, create a specialized team of LLM-powered agents that work together to analyze repositories from different perspectives:

- **Architect Agent**: Analyzes structural code changes and maintains a global understanding of the codebase architecture
- **Historian Agent**: Specializes in temporal patterns and evolutionary trends in the repository
- **Classifier Agent**: Categorizes commits by type and quality following conventional patterns[15]
- **Impact Analyzer Agent**: Traces how changes propagate through dependent components
- **Natural Language Interpreter**: Translates user queries into specific analysis tasks

This multi-agent approach mirrors successful implementations in fiction generation tools[9] and would represent a significant advancement over single-agent systems for code analysis.

### Graph-Based Repository Representation

Create a dynamic graph representation of code repositories where:

- Nodes represent code entities (functions, classes, variables)
- Edges represent relationships (calls, dependencies, imports)
- Temporal dimension captures evolution over time
- Apply Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze patterns[14][5]

Recent research on feature-wise linear modulation in GNNs could enhance your model's ability to understand relationships between code components[5].

### Commit Quality Analysis Framework

Develop a novel framework for assessing commit quality that goes beyond simple comparison with human-written messages:

- Automated classification of commits into standard types (feature, fix, docs, etc.)[15]
- Quality metrics for commit messages based on information content and explainability
- Correlation analysis between commit message quality and subsequent code maintenance efforts

Research shows LLMs can effectively classify commits, but complete automation requires sophisticated filtering techniques[8].

## Updated Feature Set

Based on your initial plan and the novelty suggestions, here's an enhanced feature set:

### Code Change Analysis
- Fine-grained AST-level diff analysis (beyond simple text diffs)
- Function boundary-aware change tracking
- Semantic change classification (not just syntactic)
- Detection of refactoring patterns vs. functional changes[1]

### Repository Structure Analysis
- Dependency graph construction and evolution tracking
- Module coupling and cohesion analysis over time
- Identification of architectural drift through commit history
- Visualization of structural changes using interactive graphs[14]

### Temporal Analysis
- Development velocity metrics by component/module
- Developer specialization patterns (who works on what)
- Bug introduction and resolution timelines
- Identification of development cycles and patterns[10]

### Natural Language Capabilities
- Causal explanation generation for code changes
- Context-aware answering of complex repository questions
- Custom prompting strategies optimized for code understanding
- Translation between technical and non-technical explanations

### Evaluation Capabilities
- Automated commit message quality assessment
- Comparison of generated explanations with ground truth
- Counterfactual analysis ("What if this change hadn't been made?")
- Generation of alternative implementation suggestions[1][8]

## Development Roadmap

To complete this project within 14 days, here's a structured roadmap:

### Days 1-2: Core Infrastructure Setup
- Set up Git data extraction pipeline for target repositories
- Implement basic diff parsing and commit message extraction
- Create initial dataset from selected open-source projects
- Design data structures for storing repository information[6][16]

### Days 3-5: Basic Analysis Features
- Implement function-level change detection
- Build commit message parser and classifier
- Create baseline LLM prompting strategies
- Develop initial evaluation metrics[3][12]

### Days 6-8: Advanced Analysis & Multi-Agent Framework
- Implement graph representation of code repositories
- Design and implement specialized agent roles
- Create agent communication protocol
- Build structural analysis components[5][14]

### Days 9-11: Integration & Refinement
- Integrate all components into cohesive system
- Implement user query interface
- Optimize prompting strategies based on initial results
- Refine evaluation metrics and testing framework[1][8]

### Days 12-14: Evaluation & Documentation
- Conduct comprehensive evaluation using established benchmarks
- Perform user studies for qualitative assessment
- Document system architecture and findings
- Prepare academic paper draft and demonstration[10]

## Structural Analysis Components

The structural analysis elements will significantly enhance your project's novelty:

### Repository Structure Modeling
- Generate AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) for each code version
- Track structural changes at semantic level
- Model inheritance hierarchies and design patterns
- Analyze how structural properties correlate with development metrics[14]

### Commit Graph Analysis
- Build commit dependency graphs (which commit affects which)
- Identify critical path commits in feature development
- Detect structural fragility through change propagation analysis
- Apply GNN techniques to predict impact of potential changes[5]

### Code Quality Metrics Integration
- Correlate structural properties with established code quality metrics
- Track how refactoring commits affect structural complexity
- Identify patterns of technical debt accumulation and resolution
- Create structural health scores for different components[10][14]

### Temporal Pattern Recognition
- Analyze cyclical patterns in development activities
- Identify phases of exploration, consolidation, and refactoring
- Detect structural breaking points in repository evolution
- Model developer behavior patterns and their impact on code structure[10]

Recent research indicates LLMs have significantly impacted maintenance commits in open-source projects (51% increase), suggesting your structural analysis could reveal important patterns in how different types of changes affect repository health[10].

## Conclusion

The proposed enhancements transform your project from a simple RAG-based system to a sophisticated multi-agent framework incorporating advanced structural analysis. The combination of graph-based representation, temporal analysis, and specialized agents creates a novel approach to repository understanding that extends beyond current state-of-the-art.

By focusing on structural properties and their evolution over time, your system will provide insights that aren't possible with text-only analysis, addressing your instructor's requirement for novelty beyond RAG. The roadmap provides a realistic path to completion within your 14-day timeframe, prioritizing core components while allowing for progressive refinement.
