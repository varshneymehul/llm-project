Excellent question! This is a fantastic area for research, sitting at the intersection of Software Engineering, NLP, and Large Language Models (LLMs). For an undergraduate at a top institution like BITS Pilani, you want an idea that is novel, technically challenging but achievable, and has the potential for a great publication or a standout thesis project.

Here is a novel research idea I've designed called **"RepoGnosis: Building a Causal and Temporal Knowledge Graph for Code Repository Q&A."**

### **The Core Idea: Moving Beyond "What" to "Why" and "How"**

Current code Q&A agents (like GitHub Copilot Chat) are excellent at answering questions about the *current state* of the code. They can explain a function, write unit tests for it, or refactor it. This is answering the **"what"** question.

The major gap is in understanding the **evolution** and **rationale** behind the code. A senior developer's deepest knowledge isn't just about what the code *is*, but *why* it is that way. This includes:
*   "Why was this seemingly inefficient algorithm chosen over a more optimal one?" (Perhaps for simplicity or due to a specific hardware constraint at the time).
*   "What was the bug that led to the creation of this `if-else` block?"
*   "Who were the key people involved in the decision to deprecate the v1 API?"

Your research would be to build a system that can answer these deeper, "archaeological" questions.

### **Project Title: RepoGnosis**

A Question Answering agent that builds a causal and temporal knowledge graph from a repository's history to answer questions about its evolution and design rationale.

### **The Problem with Existing Approaches**

Existing approaches primarily use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on the source code files themselves. They treat the repository as a static collection of text files. They largely ignore the rich, interconnected history embedded in:
1.  **Git Commit History:** The sequence of changes.
2.  **Pull Requests (PRs):** The discussions, reviews, and debates.
3.  **Issue Trackers (e.g., GitHub Issues):** The initial problem statements, bug reports, and feature requests.
4.  **Design Documents:** (If available in the repo, e.g., in Markdown files).

### **The Novelty: The Causal & Temporal Knowledge Graph (KG)**

Your innovation is to not just dump all this text into a vector database. Instead, you'll process this historical data to build a structured **Knowledge Graph**.

**What the KG would look like:**

*   **Nodes (Entities):**
    *   `File`: `auth/service.py`
    *   `Function`: `authenticate_user()`
    *   `Commit`: `a1b2c3d4`
    *   `PullRequest`: `#123`
    *   `Issue`: `#119`
    *   `Developer`: `John Doe`
    *   `Concept`: `Caching`, `Authentication`, `Database-Schema` (extracted using NLP)
    *   `Bug`: `NullPointerException` (extracted from issue/commit text)

*   **Edges (Relationships):**
    *   `Commit:a1b2c3d4` **MODIFIES** `File:auth/service.py`
    *   `Commit:a1b2c3d4` **IMPLEMENTS** `PullRequest:#123`
    *   `PullRequest:#123` **RESOLVES** `Issue:#119`
    *   `Developer:John Doe` **AUTHORED** `Commit:a1b2c3d4`
    *   `Developer:Jane Smith` **REVIEWED** `PullRequest:#123`
    *   `Commit:a1b2c3d4` **FIXES** `Bug:NullPointerException`
    *   `Function:authenticate_user()` **INTRODUCED_IN** `Commit:a1b2c3d4`
    *   `Commit:a1b2c3d4` **DISCUSSES** `Concept:Caching`

This KG creates a rich, interconnected map of the project's entire history and the logic behind it.

### **Technical Architecture & Research Steps**

This project can be broken down into manageable phases, perfect for an undergraduate timeline.

**Phase 1: Data Ingestion and Graph Construction**
1.  **Data Scraper:** Use the GitHub API (or `git` command-line tools) to pull data from a target open-source repository (e.g., `react`, `tensorflow`, `fastapi`). You'll need commits, PRs with all comments, and issues.
2.  **Entity Extraction:** Use NLP models (you can start with pre-trained ones like spaCy or Hugging Face models) to extract key entities from the unstructured text of commit messages, PR descriptions, and comments. You might need to fine-tune a model to recognize code-specific entities (`function names`, `file paths`, `library names`).
3.  **Relation Extraction:** This is a key challenge. Develop rule-based systems (e.g., looking for keywords like "fixes #123", "refactors `xyz()`") and/or a trained relation extraction model to identify the relationships between the entities.
4.  **Graph Population:** Use a graph database like **Neo4j** or **Amazon Neptune** to store your KG. Each piece of extracted information becomes a node or an edge.

**Phase 2: The Q&A Agent (RAG on the Knowledge Graph)**
1.  **Query Understanding:** When a user asks a question like, "Why was the caching in `user_service.py` changed?", your system first needs to identify the key entities in the query: `caching` (Concept), `user_service.py` (File).
2.  **Graph Traversal (The "Retrieval" Step):** Instead of a simple vector search, you perform intelligent traversals on your KG.
    *   Find the `File` node for `user_service.py`.
    *   Trace its history backwards through `MODIFIES` edges to find all `Commit` nodes that changed it.
    *   Filter these commits by checking if their associated `PR` or `Issue` nodes are linked to the `Concept` node for `Caching`.
    *   This traversal gives you a highly relevant subgraph containing the exact commits, PRs, and issues related to the caching change.
3.  **Context Augmentation:** Collect all the text data (commit messages, PR comments) from the nodes in the retrieved subgraph. This is your "context."
4.  **Answer Generation (The "Generation" Step):** Feed this rich, structured context to an LLM (e.g., via the OpenAI API, or using an open-source model like Llama 3).
    *   **Prompt:** `You are an expert software archeologist. Based on the following context from the project's history, answer the user's question. Context: [PR #456 description, Commit message, comments from Jane Doe...]. Question: "Why was the caching in user_service.py changed?"`
    *   The LLM will synthesize the information to provide a comprehensive answer, like: "The caching was changed in PR #456, which resolved Issue #450. The original LRU cache was causing memory leaks under high load. The team, led by John Doe and reviewed by Jane Smith, decided to switch to an external Redis cache to solve this, despite the added infrastructure complexity."

### **Why This is a Great BITS Pilani Project**

*   **Interdisciplinary:** It combines concepts from your courses in Databases (Graph DBs), Algorithms (Graph Traversal), AI (NLP, LLMs), and Software Engineering.
*   **Achievable Scope:** You can start with a single, well-documented repository. The complexity can be scaled up or down. You can start with rule-based extraction and move to ML-based methods if time permits.
*   **High Impact:** This is a genuinely useful tool. Companies would love a system that can onboard new developers by answering historical questions about a complex codebase. It has strong potential for a publication in a top software engineering conference (like ICSE or FSE) or an AI conference (like ACL or EMNLP).
*   **Leverages Modern Tech:** You get hands-on experience with LLMs, RAG, Graph Databases, and NLP, which are highly sought-after skills.

### **First Steps to Get Started**

1.  **Literature Review:** Read papers on "mining software repositories," "commit message analysis," and "RAG."
2.  **Tooling:** Play with the GitHub API. Install Neo4j and do their tutorials. Experiment with a pre-trained NER model from Hugging Face.
3.  **Proof of Concept:** Pick one repository. Try to manually build a small KG for just one complex PR. This will reveal the challenges and inform your automated approach.

This project goes beyond a simple application of an LLM and into the realm of structured knowledge representation, which is a more defensible and novel research contribution. Good luck
